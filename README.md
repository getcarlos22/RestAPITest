# RestAPITest
## Functional API Testing
Functional automation for API testing.
Write a test in Java for the following REST API:

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

Requirements:

* Get a random user (userID), print out its email address to console.
* Using this userID, get this userâ€™s associated posts and verify they contains a valid Post IDs (an Integer  between 1 and 100).
* Do a post using same userID with a non-empty title and body, verify the correct response is returned (since this is a mock API, it might not return Response code 200, so check the documentation).

On average, this task can be completed in 2-3 hours, but you are welcome to spend more time on it to submit a better quality code.
